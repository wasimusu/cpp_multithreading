/**
 * Description: Multi-threading is used to achieve full resource utilization that single-threaded applications cannot achieve.
 * For instance, if processing a single image at a time is only taking up on 20% of the CPU resource, then processing 4 or 5 images
 * simulatenously may lead to full utilization of the CPU resource and shorter wait time for users.
 *
 * Also, if your program has separate independent functions instead of waiting for function to finish to execute other
 * functions in a serial fashion, you can execute all of the functions in parallel using multi-threading.
