/**
 * Objective: Demonstrate data race.
 *
 * Definition: Data race is multiple threads trying to manipulate shared data at the same time. 
 * For instance, if two threads are trying to increment the same counter the counter may be incremented by 1 or 2 
 * which is not a desirable outcome when in fact the counter should be incremented by 2.
 * 
 * To resolve this see: thread_safe_counters.cpp
